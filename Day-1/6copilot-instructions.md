# Using GitHub Copilot for PEP8-Compliant Python Coding

GitHub Copilot can help you write Python code that adheres to PEP8 standards. Follow these steps to ensure your code remains clean and compliant:

## 1. Enable GitHub Copilot
- Install the GitHub Copilot extension in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- Sign in with your GitHub account and enable Copilot for your workspace.

## 2. Write PEP8-Compliant Code
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Follow indentation rules (4 spaces per level).
- Limit line length to 79 characters.
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes.
- Add comments and docstrings where necessary.

## 3. Use Copilot Suggestions
- Start typing your code, and Copilot will suggest completions.
- Review the suggestions to ensure they align with PEP8 standards.
- Modify suggestions if needed to meet PEP8 requirements.

## 4. Use a Linter for Validation
- Install a Python linter like `flake8` or `pylint` to validate your code.
- Run the linter to check for PEP8 violations:
  ```bash
  pip install flake8
  flake8 your_script.py
